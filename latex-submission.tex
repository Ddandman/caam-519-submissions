\section{A script to build a latex document while hiding auxiliary files}

#!/bin/bash

read Projectname       \quad\quad Taking a project name as an input

mkdir -p .build         \quad\quad making a hidden directory called .build

new name = "Project name+.tex"      

pdflatex new name \quad\quad creating a tex document with the new name

mv $Projectname.aux .build$      \quad\quad send auxiliary files to .build

mv $Projectname.log .build

mv $textput.log .build\\

Two ways that this code could lead to undesirable behavior is if the project files are also uploaded to the build directory, and if the auxiliary files get sent to the main directory.
